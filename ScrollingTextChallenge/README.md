ScrollingTextChallenge - Solution Code
======================================

The Scrolling Text app demonstrates the ScrollView UI component.
This version includes the coding challenge - it adds a Button
to the end of the text that scrolls with the text.

Introduction
------------

The app shows how to use a ScrollView to display text. The user can
scroll vertically to read by swiping up and down. The app shows how

to bold or italic, and with new-line characters to separate paragraphs.
You can also include active web links in the text.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- How to open, build, and run apps in Android Studio.
- How to open and edit an XML layout file.

Getting Started
---------------
